0,"Since new evidence regarding the impact of Wendler glottoplasty (WG) on the voice in transgender women became available in the literature in recent years, we aimed to perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the actual safety and efficacy of WG in the process of vocal feminization."
1,"Patients with gender dysphoria face significant health disparities and barriers to care. Transition-related care includes hormonal therapy, mental healthcare, and gender-affirming surgeries. Studies have described favorable surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction, however, the degree to which these procedures impact mental health conditions is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gender-affirming plastic surgery on mental health and substance abuse in the transgender population."
2,"For diagnosis of osteoporosis, a -score of ≤-2.5 is recommended for all transgender and gender-diverse patients aged 50 years or older, regardless of hormonal status. This case series presents 3 transgender individuals younger than 50 years undergoing gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) who had DXA scores suggestive of osteoporosis. We highlight possible discrepancies in DXA scan interpretations, especially in forearm bone mineral density measurements. We present the baseline (prior to beginning GAHT), 6-month, and 1-year follow-up DXA data along with pertinent labs to include 25-OH vitamin D, calcium, and alkaline phosphatase, for 2 transgender males (assigned female at birth) and 1 transgender female (assigned male at birth) undergoing GAHT who had low -scores and -scores suggestive of osteoporosis. Multiple studies have analyzed the BMD data of individuals taking GAHT over time, which identify possible causes for low baseline -scores for transgender females, but less so for transgender males. Other than positional statements, guidelines remain unclear regarding diagnostic approaches to osteoporosis and low -scores in transgender individuals who are premenopausal or under 50 years of age. This case series addresses discrepancies in interpretation that may be encountered by clinicians with baseline and follow-up DXAs, especially involving the forearm, during the course of GAHT. This highlights the importance of establishing clearer guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis and low BMD for chronological age in the transgender population."
3,"Injectable neurotoxins and fillers are potential options for facial gender affirmation for transgender/nonbinary patients. However, the largest barrier to access is cost/insurance coverage."
4,"Transgender women are disproportionately affected by HIV and are underutilizing preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The lower uptake of PrEP by transgender women may be, in part, owing to the perception that taking PrEP may lower the efficacy of gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or to provider concerns that GAHT may lower the efficacy of PrEP."
5,"Tucking is the gender-affirming practice of putting the penis and scrotum between the buttocks and moving the testes up into the inguinal canals. Our study explores tucking and health effects among transfeminine adults (=79). Most (74.7%) had practiced tucking and among them, 67.2% had tucked ≥7 years. When tucking, the majority (84.5%) tucked daily and almost half (44.8%) ≥17 h/day. Half (50.0%) reported concern about the health effects of tucking. Itching, rash, and testicular pain were the most commonly reported health effects. Health care providers should use a harm reduction approach in addressing tucking-related concerns and supporting patients who tuck."
6,"Parental support is associated with improved mental health outcomes for gender diverse youth (GDY). Parents often seek guidance from pediatric providers, but few studies explore what actions make GDY feel supported. Using a qualitative analysis of open-ended survey responses, we aimed to identify ways in which GDY want to be supported by their parents or caregivers. Nine key themes were identified, including using affirming language at home and other settings as desired by GDY, seeking education, and aiding in accessing affirming items and care. Findings from this study can help pediatric medical and mental health providers help parents to support their GDY."
7,The purpose of this study was to identify health care transition (HCT) readiness and skills among transgender youth transitioning gender-affirming care from pediatric to adult providers.
8,Gender-affirming hormones (hormones)-the use of sex hormones to induce desired secondary sex characteristics in transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) individuals-are vital health care for many TGNB people. Some hormone providers require a letter from a mental health provider before hormone initiation. We explore the perspectives of TGNB individuals regarding the impact of the letter requirement on their experience of care.
9,"The transgender community utilizes online platforms to view and share postoperative masculinizing top surgery photographs. However, the quantitative and qualitative nature of these photographs is unknown. We aimed to conduct an analysis of postoperative online photographs for nipple-areolar complex (NAC) shape and location, and compare social media platforms to World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) surgeons' websites and published cis-male chest proportions."
10,Little is known about the prevalence and risks associated with transgender and gender diverse (TGD) persons' misuse of prescription pain relievers (PPRs). This study explores the relationship between PPR misuse and various sociodemographic identities and experiences of discrimination in health care among TGD adults.
11,"The sociopolitical context in which transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) people live has significant effects on mental health. We examined whether perceptions of context (TGD people's perceptions of how TGD people were viewed) differed across four United States (U.S.) states and associations with mental health and identity pride, the mediational effects of minority stressors, and potential buffering effects of resilience."
12,"Resilience is often viewed as the ability to bounce back from challenges. This conceptualization tends to be individualistic and can be less fitting for marginalized communities. Research with transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals has shown that resilience can manifest in various ways, such as developing pride in one's identity, connection to a TGD community, or advocating against oppression. Given these conflicting views, we sought to (1) describe common themes in TGD people's experience of resilience by pooling information from qualitative research; and (2) evaluate how well quantitative measures of resilience reflected the ways that TGD people define resilience in qualitative research. We reviewed articles published from January 2010 to January 2020. Our search for research on resilience in TGD samples revealed 33 quantitative articles and 17 qualitative articles. We developed a codebook from the qualitative articles by retrieving information about themes from these past studies (e.g., developing motivation and agency, pride or positive self-image). We also reviewed the quantitative studies and retrieved the measures used to assess resilience, followed by coding these scales to understand whether the themes from the qualitative data were reflected in the quantitative measures of resilience. Overall, themes related to social support were common across the measures. However, other themes were not reflected in any measures, such as self-definition of gender, hope, and self-advocacy. Our research demonstrates the discrepancy between qualitative research on TGD resilience and quantitative measurement of resilience. Measure development that more fully reflects TGD people's experiences is key to advancing this research."
13,Transgender girls' right to participate in high school sports has been attacked by legislation banning them from doing so. This study uses open-ended survey responses among transgender high school girls to examine reasons that they choose to participate or not participate in sports.
14,"Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals continue to face adversity, stigma, and inequality, especially in health care. This study aimed to characterize the experience of TGD people and partners of TGD people with regard to fertility treatment."
15,"Stigma is a fundamental driver of HIV disparities among transgender women (TW). The gender minority stress and resilience (GMSR) measure has not been validated in Spanish-speaking, resource-limited settings. We examined the psychometric properties of a translated and abbreviated GMSR among TW in Tijuana, Mexico."
16,"Black sexual minority men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States are at disparate risk for contracting HIV infection, but pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use is suboptimal. Social network methods were used to recruit a community sample of racial minority MSM and transgender women (TGW) in two Midwestern US cities. 250 PrEP-eligible (HIV-negative) participants completed measures assessing current and intended PrEP use; demographic characteristics; PrEP knowledge, attitudes, norms, stigma, and self-efficacy; and structural barriers to PrEP. Multivariate analyses established predictors of current and intended PrEP use. Only 12% of participants reported currently using PrEP, which was associated with greater PrEP knowledge and not having a main partner, with trends for greater PrEP use by younger participants and those with partners living with HIV. Among participants not currently on PrEP, strength of PrEP use intentions was associated with higher PrEP knowledge, PrEP descriptive social norms, and PrEP use self-efficacy. This study is among few to directly compare Black who have adopted PrEP with those who have not. Its findings underscore the potential benefits of employing social network approaches for strengthening PrEP use peer norms, increasing PrEP knowledge and self-efficacy, and optimizing PrEP uptake among racial minority MSM and TGW."
17,Treatment guidelines for gender-affirming hormone therapy with estrogen (GAHT-E) recommend specific dosing regimens based on limited data. Well-controlled efficacy trials are essential to tailoring treatment to patient goals as the guidelines recommend. The goal of this study was to take a foundational step toward designing community-centered effectiveness trials for gender-diverse individuals seeking GAHT-E.

19,"Hopelessness is a key risk factor for suicide. This analysis explored whether hopelessness indicates a recent suicide crisis state and is linked with magnetoencephalography (MEG) oscillatory power and effective connectivity differences. Change in hopelessness ratings and effective connectivity post-ketamine were also evaluated in a subsample of high-risk individuals to evaluate correlates of dynamic changes over time. Participants (66F;44 M;1 transgender) included individuals with suicide crisis in the last two weeks (High Risk (HR), n = 14), those with past suicide attempt but no recent suicide ideation (SI) (Low Risk (LR), n = 37), clinical controls (CC, n = 33), and healthy volunteers at minimal risk (MinR, n = 27). MEG oscillatory power and clinical hopelessness ratings (via the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)) were evaluated across groups. Dynamic casual modeling (DCM) evaluated connectivity within and between the anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). A subsample of HR individuals who received ketamine (n = 10) were evaluated at Day 1 post-infusion. The HR group reported the highest levels of hopelessness, even when adjusting for SI. MEG results linked hopelessness with reduced activity across frequency bands in salience network regions, with no group or group-by-interaction effects. Using DCM, the HR group had reduced intrinsic drive from granular Layer IV stellate cells to superficial pyramidal cells in the ACC and AI. In the pilot HR study, reduced hopelessness was linked with increased drive for this same connection post-ketamine. Hopelessness is a possible proxy for suicide risk. Electrophysiological targets for hopelessness include widespread reductions in salience network activity, particularly in the ACC and AI."
20,"Transgender young adults (TYA) are burdened by adverse mental health outcomes. Guided by intersectionality and minority stress frameworks, we compared prevalence of psychological distress and suicidality among TYA of different social identities to inform future interventions."
21,"Current eating disorder treatment approaches for youth were developed for use with cisgender girls, which limits the understanding of effectiveness for cisgender boys and transgender and gender expansive (TGE) youth. Here, we compare treatment outcomes for cisgender boys and TGE youth with cisgender girls receiving family-based treatment for an eating disorder."
22,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) consist of instances of abuse, neglect, or household dysfunction occurring before adulthood. Prevalence rates of ACEs are higher among specific populations, including gender minorities. In addition to ACEs, transgender individuals (TG) face many personal, social, and structural factors that have the potential to negatively impact their physical health."
23,"Despite federally mandated collection of sex and gender demographics in the electronic health record (EHR), longitudinal assessments are lacking. We assessed sex and gender demographic field utilization using EHR metadata."
24,"This exploratory qualitative study sought to better understand the experiences of Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (2SLGBTQ+) disabled people when learning about sexuality, sexual orientation, and gender identity. We conducted 31 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with adults labeled/with developmental and intellectual disabilities in Alberta, Canada. Findings showed a significant lack of comprehensive sex education available to 2SLGBTQ+ disabled people. Sexual and gender identities were rarely discussed in formal school-based education settings and most parents and caregivers did not feel comfortable addressing these topics either. As a result, many participants had to do their own research and use other sources for information and advice. Participants then provided recommendations in terms of what they wish they had learned in sex education as well as potentially effective ways of delivering that content to disabled people."
25,"Research shows that LGBTQ workers make strategic decisions about whether to disclose their sexual and gender identities to their colleagues as they assess potential costs and benefits. The present study sought to extend this literature by examining how they plan their identity disclosure in future workplace interactions and why they may diverge from their initial intentions. The analysis used longitudinal data from in-depth interviews, in which young LGBTQ workers reported disclosure intentions and their outcomes two years later. Participants often expressed intentions to disclose their LGBTQ identities while emphasizing the importance of identity disclosure for self-authenticity and the LGBTQ community's visibility. Sometime over the course of the study, however, a substantial number of participants did not carry out their intentions because of unanticipated workplace constraints such as a lack of opportunities for personal conversations, an expectation for professionalism, and an absence of LGBTQ colleagues. However, participants who diverged from their initial disclosure intentions maintained an identity as an open LGBTQ person by emphasizing their willingness for disclosure."
26,"Transgender, non-binary, and gender diverse people face discrimination and barriers to accessing health care. Existing evidence suggests higher rates of mental health conditions among these groups compared with binary and cisgender groups. However, information is limited by poor gender recording in health records and surveys. We aimed to provide the first national estimates of gender-related inequalities in self-reported mental health conditions and mental health support across 15 gender groups in England."
27,"Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training is essential to graduate medical education, but it lacks standardization. Although the impact of providers' biases and cultural competency on patient outcomes is well documented, the value of and satisfaction with DEI curricula in Pediatrics residency training programs is not well studied. This study aimed to complete a cross-sectional evaluation of the current DEI curriculum at a large Pediatrics-focused academic institution and identify areas of perceived deficiency among Pediatrics trainees."
28,"The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a patient-reported outcome measure for gender incongruence specific to voice and communication parameters, including pitch, intonation, resonance, loudness, speech smoothness, speech clarity, word choice, facial expression, gesture, and posture."
29,"This paper critically analyses three main neurobiological hypotheses on trans* identities: the neurobiological theory about the origin of gender dysphoria, the neurodevelopmental cortical hypothesis, and the alternative hypothesis of self-referential thinking and body perception. In this study I focus then the attention on three elements: the issue of (de)pathologisation, the idea of the trans brain, and the aetiology of trans* identities. While the neurobiological theory about the origin of gender dysphoria and the neurodevelopmental cortical hypothesis claim the existence of the trans brain, each offering its own neurobiological depiction, the hypothesis of self-referential thinking and body perception doesn't postulate a distinctive neurobiological trait for all trans* people. I problematize both portrayals of the trans brain departing from the findings and conceptualizations of the paradigm shifting brain mosaicism. Unlike the hypothesis of self-referential thinking and body perception that keeps the question of causation open, both the neurobiological theory about the origin of gender dysphoria and the neurodevelopmental cortical hypothesis situate the origin of trans* identities in the neurobiological domain. I challenge the biological deterministic framework in which this aetiology is inscribed from a dynamic processual entanglement perspective. Finally, concerning the issue of (de)pathologisation of trans* identities, an evolution can be seen in each of the hypothesis and among them, from the least to the most depathologising. However, I question their complete departure from a pathologising framework."
30,"Sex determination in forensic medicine is considered one of the first and foremost steps in personal identification. The need for identifying the exact sex of the individual arises when deciding whether a person can exercise certain civil rights reserved for one particular sex, for competing in sex-specific athletic and sports events, legitimacy, divorce, paternity disputes and also to some criminal offenses. Nuclear sexing by Barr body examination can be done using buccal smears to establish the sex of the individual when routine methods fail to disclose the exact gender of the individual."
31,Barriers exist in access to primary care as well as specialty healthcare such as gender-affirming care. Understanding the referral sources used to identify new providers for these types of care can help healthcare systems facilitate access.
32,"The law has slowly recognised the concept of a transgender person. After initially fixating on someone's physical birth gender, it has now accepted the concept of gender identity. It has been challenged by young people experiencing gender dysphoria seeking medical treatment. Though in recent years it has increasingly accepted the right of such a person to access appropriate treatment, this article suggests further improvements in this area of the law are desirable, including no longer making the distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic treatment, reforming the extent of judicial power in this context, and according greater autonomy to mature young people."
33,Hormone therapy in transgender people might be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We aimed to investigate whether the risk of CVD is increased in transgender people compared with people of the same birth sex.

36,"Oocyte donation has greatly expanded in the past several decades since the first procedure was performed in 1983. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the number of cycles using donor oocytes increased from 18,011 cycles in 2010 to 27,131 cycles in 2019. Oocyte donation has become an important reproductive option for women with diminished ovarian reserve, recurrent failed in vitro fertilization, or heritable genetic conditions. It is also particularly important for single men, same-sex male couples, and men with a transgender woman partner. More recently, societal changes accompanying the expansion of social media and broader access to direct-to-consumer DNA testing have raised concerns about privacy and anonymity. In this article, we review two specific aspects of donor privacy: privacy related to personal identifiers provided by clinics or donor egg bank websites and privacy related to direct-to-consumer genetic testing. We also provide clinical recommendations specific to the United States for working with oocyte donors and donor oocyte recipients."
37,"Our study examined factors associated with transgender and gender diverse (""trans"") people's experience of sexual coercion, as well as the factors associated with help-seeking and wellbeing among victims/survivors.  We analyzed cross-sectional data from the first Australian Trans and Gender Diverse Sexual Health Survey, conducted in 2018. Logistic regressions were undertaken to identify factors associated with sexual coercion, help-seeking, and wellbeing.  Of the sample of 1448 participants, 53.4% had been sexually coerced, which was associated with older age, Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, nonbinary gender, being presumed female gender at birth, currently living publicly some or all the time as their affirmed gender, having regular sex, and use of drugs to enhance or alter sexual experiences. Protective factors included having a higher income and access to gender affirming care. Help-seeking was reported among 49.5% of victims/survivors and was associated with having more trans friends. Wellbeing among victims/survivors was associated with being older, residing in regional/remote areas, having higher levels of education and annual income, being presumed female gender at birth, having stronger satisfaction with one's sex life, and good health care access. Wellbeing was not associated with help-seeking.  Sexual coercion was prevalent among participants, but help-seeking behavior was low. Protective factors identified underscore the importance of socioeconomic supports, access to health and gender affirming care, and peers. Accessible peer-led and culturally safe preventive and trauma-focused supports should also be considered for trans people who experience sexual coercion."
38,"We explored correlates of cannabis risk and examined differences between sexual and gender minority (SGM) and cisgender heterosexual emerging adults (ages 18-29) in California.  We recruited 1491 participants aged 18-29 years for a cross-sectional online survey. Ordinal logistic regressions assessed associations between minority stress (discrimination and internalized homophobia [IH]), social support (perceived social support and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer+ [LGBTQ+] community connectedness), and cannabis risk scores (low, medium, and high risk of developing problems related to their cannabis use). We also explored differences in cannabis risk scores by sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI).  Higher everyday discrimination scores were associated with increased odds of self-scoring in a higher cannabis risk range (adjusted odds ratio = 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31-1.79). We found no significant associations for IH, LGBTQ+ community connectedness, or social support on cannabis risk scores. There were also no statistically significant differences by SOGI groups; however, SOGI did moderate the relationship between IH and cannabis risk score such that the slope for IH was 0.43 units higher for cisgender sexual minority women compared to cisgender sexual minority men (95% CI = 0.05-0.81).  Our findings suggest that experiences of everyday discrimination are important contributors to developing cannabis-related problems and IH may have more pronounced effects for sexual minority women compared to sexual minority men. More research is needed to better understand risk and protective factors of cannabis risk to inform the development of culturally tailored interventions for SGM emerging adults."
39,"The ""one-liner,"" commonly used in clinical communications, summarizes a patient's identity, presenting condition, medical history, and clinical findings. Imprecise, inconsistent use of gender and sex information in one-liners threatens the provision of affirming care to transgender, nonbinary, gender-expansive, and intersex patients and may exacerbate health care disparities. This study aimed to generate guidance for communicating gender and sex information in one-liners.  This is an explanatory sequential, equal status mixed methods study of transgender, nonbinary, gender-expansive, and intersex people and clinicians caring for this population. Survey participants rated one-liners on a five-point Likert-type scale of appropriateness, considering affirmation and clinical utility, and provided open-ended comments. We conducted two focus groups with survey respondents to explore survey results and performed a thematic analysis of survey comments and focus group transcripts.  Survey respondents included 57 clinicians and 80 nonclinicians. One-liners containing patient pronouns were rated most appropriate, and appropriate patient descriptors included self-described gender identity or gender-neutral terms. In scenarios where patient sex information was not pertinent to the chief concern (CC), one-liners containing no sex information were rated most appropriate. Four themes were identified: inclusion of sex information based on relevance to the CC, accurate patient representation, influence of clinical setting, and risk of harm from inaccurate one-liners.  This study generated data to support the appropriate use of gender and sex language in one-liners. Clinicians, educators, and trainees may use these findings to compose one-liners that are affirming and clinically useful for patients of diverse gender and sex identities."
40,"This article introduces the multidimensional properties of social connectedness among sexual and gender minority (SGM) midlife and older adults and examines the relationship between these properties and general health. Data were analyzed from Aging With Pride: National, Aging, and Sexuality/Gender Study, including 2,450 SGM adults aged 50 and older in the United States. The structure, function, and quality of interpersonal relations as well as community-level activities and engagement were measured through a self-administered survey and an in-person interview. Findings indicated that SGM midlife and older adults, on average, had a large social network with high bridging potential and low density, consisting of more nonrelative family members than immediate family members. They also showed frequent availability of social support, moderate or higher satisfaction with interpersonal relations, and moderate SGM community engagement. Properties of social connectedness differed by gender, sexual identity, and gender identity, with SGM men, sexually diverse women, and transgender people showing distinct challenges in interpersonal relations. All aspects of social connectedness were positively associated with good general health, particularly network diversity, outdoor leisure activity engagement, and access to health-related decision support, controlling for age and chronic conditions. Care receiving and loneliness were negatively associated with good general health. Intervention development can target these factors to promote social and community connectivity and reduce the negative health effects of persistent social stressors. This study underscores the necessity of addressing all facets (i.e., structure, function, and quality) of interpersonal relations encompassing both immediate and chosen family as well as community-level social connectedness.

44,"The International Anal Neoplasia Society (IANS) developed consensus guidelines to inform anal cancer screening use among various high-risk groups. Anal cancer incidence estimates by age among risk groups provided the basis to identify risk thresholds to recommend screening. Guided by risk thresholds, screening initiation at age 35 years was recommended for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TW) with HIV. For other people with HIV and MSM and TW not with HIV, screening initiation at age 45 years was recommended. For solid organ transplant recipients, screening initiation beginning from 10 years post-transplant was recommended. For persons with a history of vulvar precancer or cancer, screening initiation was recommended starting within 1 year of diagnosis of vulvar precancer or cancer. Persons aged ≥45 years with a history of cervical/vaginal HSIL or cancer, perianal warts, persistent (>1 year) cervical HPV16, or autoimmune conditions could be considered for screening with shared decision-making, provided there is adequate capacity to perform diagnostic procedures (high-resolution anoscopy [HRA]). Anal cytology, high-risk (hr) human papillomavirus (HPV) testing (including genotyping for HPV16), and hrHPV-cytology co-testing are different strategies currently used for anal cancer screening that show acceptable performance. Thresholds for referral for HRA or follow-up screening tests are delineated. These recommendations from IANS provide the basis to inform management of abnormal screening results, considering currently available screening tools. These guidelines provide a pivotal foundation to help generate consensus among providers and inform the introduction and implementation of risk-targeted screening for anal cancer prevention."

46,"America has experienced a rapid increase in loneliness, substance use, and suicidality. This increase is particularly deleterious for Veterans, who, as compared to nonmilitary-connected civilians, experience elevated rates of loneliness, substance use, and suicidality. In this project we investigated the link between loneliness, substance use, and suicidality, paying particular attention to the mediational role of loneliness between substance use and suicidality. 1,469 Veterans (male,  = 1004, 67.2%; female,  = 457, 32.3%; transgender/non-binary/prefer not to say,  = 8, 0.5%) answered online surveys in the Mental Health and Well-Being Project. Items assessed participants on psychosocial antecedents of health and wellness. Pearson correlations and mediational models were used to determine if loneliness, substance use, and suicidality were related and if loneliness mediated the link between substance use and suicidality. Results indicated that loneliness, substance use, and suicidality were significantly and positively related (s = .33-.42, s < .01). Additionally, loneliness partially mediated the link between substance use and suicidality ( = .08 [.06-.10]), suggesting that, within the context of substance use in Veterans, loneliness may account for significant variance in suicidality. Together findings suggest the Veterans Health Administration should support, fund, and study community engagement activities that could reduce the development or intensity of substance use, loneliness, and suicidality in Veterans."

49,"Fertility preservation (FP) involves the cryopreservation of gametes, embryos, and/or gonadal tissue oocytes, for future use in family building. FP as part of a comprehensive approach to care of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals is an understudied topic. Current evidence indicates that gender affirming therapies may increase the risk for infertility. As a result, TGD individuals, including adolescents, should receive counseling regarding FP prior to beginning gender affirming treatment. Many barriers exist to TGD adolescents receiving FP counseling and undergoing FP if desired. The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the literature regarding the desire for FP in TGD adolescents, the barriers to TGD adolescents in accessing of FP, and to discuss potential interventions for alleviation of such barriers. A literature search using the following Medical Subject Headings search terms: 'transgender persons' and 'fertility preservation' and 'adolescents' was conducted  searching PubMed. Additional articles were located  reference review. Included articles consist of qualitative and quantitative research and society guidelines. Articles from inception to 1st July 2023 were included. The results of the literature search have been summarized into the format of a narrative review. Key barriers to FP for TGD adolescents include inconsistencies in form and timing of counseling, potential worsening of gender dysphoria with FP treatment, high cost of treatment, limited research on FP outcomes, and legal barriers. Intersectionality between gender identity and other forms of minority status can compound these barriers to FP and healthcare in general. Barriers to TGD adolescents accessing FP are significant. Increased research is needed upon methods to mitigate these barriers. Solutions include increasing uniformity and timing of FP counseling by varying health care providers, advocacy efforts to mitigate legal and financial barriers, increased research efforts in FP outcomes, and increased cultural competency in clinics offering FP care to TGD adolescents."
50,"In the context of body image and mental health, transgender individuals face distinctive challenges stemming from the complexities of their gender identity journey, societal expectations, and body norms. However, the existing line of research on this topic remains limited. This study explores the complex relationship in transgender individuals between body objectification, body weight dissatisfaction, and eating concerns. A sample of 154 individuals (77 transgenders paired with 77 cisgenders) was recruited via LGBTQ+ groups' mailing lists. Participants completed various questionnaires assessing body image, eating psychopathology, depression, and body objectification. Propensity score matching was performed with different variables: age, current BMI, years of education, current self-identified gender, and sexual orientation. The results revealed that transgender individuals experienced higher levels of body objectification, body weight dissatisfaction, and eating concerns compared to their cisgender counterparts. Additionally, age emerged as a protective factor, as older transgender individuals demonstrated improved body acceptance and self-esteem. Logistic regression analyzes indicated that bulimic behaviors, depressive symptoms, and appearance control beliefs were specific factors significantly associated with being transgender. Our findings highlight the unique challenges faced by transgender individuals in navigating their gender identity and body image, underscoring the importance of targeted interventions and support systems."

52,"Rates of suicidality and self-harm are substantial among trans and gender diverse people, particularly among younger groups. The objective of this scoping review is to explore the state of the research conducted on determinants of mental distress, self-harm and suicidality among trans and gender diverse (TGD) youth from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was used as a methodology guide. Inclusion criteria for study selection comprehended: publications on the intersectionality between gender non-conformity and cultural and linguistic diversity; focus on a young population (≤25 years of age); publications addressing self-harm and/or suicidality. Searches were conducted on eight databases and a public web search engine and yielded 474 results. Publications were screened and selected by two independent reviewers. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes overarching the findings. The screening process yielded seven peer-reviewed studies and six research reports based on case studies, retrospective qualitative interviews, cross-sectional and longitudinal survey analyses. The key themes approached in the retrieved literature include: (1) precipitating factors for suicidality; (2) pathways contributing to self-harm and suicidality; and 3) barriers and facilitators for accessing services and mental health care. Practical actions to help mitigate suicidality among TGD youth from CALD backgrounds need to consider the impact of trauma and allow for the development of trust in the therapeutic relationship. Shifts in service delivery and policy formulation are necessary to reduce stigmatisation and potentialise the inclusion of different racial, ethnic, cultural, sexual and gender identity expressions in society."
53,"Rates of suicidality and self-harm are substantial among trans and gender diverse people, particularly among younger groups.

59,"HIV self-testing (HIVST) is where individuals collect their specimens and perform the HIV test privately. HIVST has improved testing uptake and coverage, especially among vulnerable groups of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Vulnerable groups include key populations such as men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who inject drugs, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons and young women. However, little is known about the determinants and acceptability of HIVST among these groups in SSA. Therefore, this scoping review aims to explore the determinants and acceptability of HIVST among vulnerable groups in SSA."

61,"Hormone therapy (HT) is important and frequently used both regarding replacement therapy (HRT) and gender affirming therapy (GAHT). While HRT has been effective in addressing symptoms related to hormone shortage, several side effects have been described. In this context, there are some studies that show increased cardiovascular risk. However, there are also studies reporting protective aspects of HT. Nevertheless, the exact impact of HT on cardiovascular risk and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This article explores the relationship between diverse types of HT and cardiovascular risk, focusing on mechanistic insights of the underlying hormones on platelet and leukocyte function as well as on effects on endothelial and adipose tissue cells."
62,"In recent years, facial feminization surgery (FFS) has gained increasing popularity because of increases in transgender individuals and the acceptance of diversity in gender identity.

63,"This study aimed to conduct a moderated mediation analysis to understand further the complex pathways through which structural stigma in the form of transgender sports bans was associated with suicidal ideation and behaviors among sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults.  A cross-sectional survey of 1033 adults who identified as SGM from across the 50 U.S. states and Washington, DC was conducted between January 28 and February 7, 2022. Distal discrimination distress was the mediation variable; individual resilience and social resources were the moderation variables. Familiarity with transgender sports bans represented structural stigma. The conditional process analysis was applied to build a moderated mediation model. Both conditional direct and indirect effects were computed by estimated coefficients. All models were based on linear regression.  Our final model explained nearly half (46%) of the variation in suicidal ideation and behaviors between those SGM adults familiar and those not familiar with transgender sports bans. Social resources significantly moderated the conditional indirect effect of distal discrimination distress (adjusted estimate = -0.23; 95% confidence interval = -0.37 to -0.08).  Both discrimination distress and social resources influenced the association between structural stigma as measured by familiarity with transgender sports bans and suicidal ideation and behaviors among SGM adults. Findings support the need for future research examining the pathway between structural stigma and suicidal ideation and behaviors among SGM adults and how minority stress, social safety, and other constructs shape this pathway."
64,"Transgender women, especially transgender women of color, are disproportionately affected by HIV. However, no surveillance system collects data on HIV risk factors among this population. To address this gap, CDC developed a surveillance system entitled National HIV Behavioral Surveillance Among Transgender Women (NHBS-Trans) to assess behavioral and contextual data through systematic biobehavioral surveillance to monitor behavioral risk factors, prevention usage, and HIV prevalence among transgender women. NHBS-Trans used respondent-driven sampling in seven urban areas in the United States. Trained interviewers used a standardized, anonymous questionnaire to collect information on HIV-related behavioral risk factors, HIV testing, and use of prevention services. Each of the seven participating project areas recruited approximately 200 eligible transgender women and offered anonymous HIV testing. Overall, in the seven project areas, 1,757 participants completed the eligibility screener for NHBS-Trans during 2019-2020; of these, 6.6% were seeds (i.e., a limited number of initial participants who were chosen by referrals from persons and community-based organizations who knew or were part of the local population of transgender women). A total of 1,637 (93.2%) participants were eligible, consented, and completed the interview. Of these, 1,624 (99.2%) agreed to HIV testing. Of the total 1,637 participants, 29 participants did not report identity of woman or transgender woman, resulting in a final sample of 1,608 transgender women. NHBS-Trans project area staff members (n = 14) reported that the survey was timely and addressed a critical need for HIV surveillance in a population that is often overlooked. The MMWR supplement includes this overview report on NHBS-Trans, which describes the methods (history, participant eligibility criteria, questionnaire, data collection, and HIV testing) as well as evaluation of project implementation and the performance of the questionnaire content, specifically the acceptability for transgender women. The other NHBS-Trans reports in the supplement include information on pre-exposure prophylaxis use, psychosocial syndemic conditions and condomless anal intercourse, nonprescription hormone use, homelessness, discrimination and the association between employment discrimination and health care access and use, and social support and the association between certain types of violence and harassment (gender-based verbal and physical abuse or harassment, physical intimate partner abuse or harassment, and sexual violence) and suicidal ideation. NHBS-Trans provides important data related to the goals of the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. initiative. Findings from NHBS-Trans can help guide community leaders, clinicians, and public health officials in improving access to and use of HIV prevention and treatment services by transgender women."
65,"Treating gender identity as a fixed characteristic may contribute to considerable misclassification and hinder accurate characterization of health inequities and the design of effective preventive interventions for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adolescents and young adults. We examined changes in how an ethnically and racially diverse sample of TGD adolescents and young adults reported their gender identity over time, the implications of this fluidity on public health, and the potential effects of misclassification of gender identity."

67,"The aim of this study was to create a continuous drug delivery system that would yield serum testosterone levels in sexually mature, female pigs consistent with serum testosterone levels of human transgender men. Testosterone enanthate was mixed with medical grade silicone at a ratio of 20 % by weight, placed in silastic tubing to cure at room temperature for 24 h, then removed from the tubing mold and stored at 4 °C until surgical implantation. Testosterone enanthate oxidizes at high temperatures which is why the implants had to be stored cold. Each implant was 9 cm long and contained 0.56 g of testosterone enanthate. A minimum of one implant (0.56 g testosterone enanthate) and a maximum of four implants (2.24 g testosterone enanthate) were placed in the cervical subcutaneous fat of each pig. After implantation, serum testosterone was assessed over 40 days. Silastic testosterone enanthate implants increase serum testosterone and maintain it in a relatively constant state in a dose-dependent manner for ∼ 21-25 days post-implantation. •Effective method for subcutaneous delivery of large quantities of testosterone or testosterone metabolites in compact implants to large animal biomedical model species.•Maintains increased circulating testosterone levels for up to 3, 4 weeks post-implantation in pigs."
68,"Socially constructed gender norms influence people's access to, and experience of, healthcare. Gender norms can negatively affect the health of women, men and people with other gender identities, such as transgender or non-binary individuals. Person-centred care and shared decision-making, which are widely recognised as essential aspects of healthcare, could be effective approaches for enhancing gender equality in healthcare for women. However, many women appear to receive suboptimal person-centred care. Additionally, there is a lack of representation of diverse gender identities in research, as well as a lack of awareness of diverse gender identities among nurses and other healthcare professionals. To enhance gender equality in healthcare for women, nurses and nursing students should be encouraged to reflect on their unconscious biases and adopt a stance of cultural curiosity, while organisations need to improve preregistration and post-registration training on equality and diversity."

70,"Although national medical organizations often neglect to include trans and gender diverse (TGD) people in their breast and cervical cancer screening recommendations, the World Profession Association of Transgender Health recommends that TGD people who are at risk for these cancers follow existing guidelines for cisgender women. Despite WPATH's recommendations, TGD people are less likely to get screened in large part due to discrimination. The COVID-19 pandemic has limited access to cancer screenings among cisgender people, but it is unknown how this has impacted TGD people."
71,"Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people who use drugs report barriers to accessing substance use treatment, including provider mistreatment.

72,"The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in March 2020 caused a dramatic change in the way many people lived. Few aspects of daily life were left undisrupted by the pandemic's onset as well as the accompanying policies to control the spread of the disease. Previous research has found that the pandemic may have significantly impacted the mental health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals-potentially more so than other individuals. However, the pandemic did not affect all areas of the United States at the same time, and there may be regional variation in the impact of the onset of the pandemic on depressive symptoms among LGBTQ individuals."
73,"Γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is widely abused due to its sedative/hypnotic and euphoric effects. In recent years, GHB use has witnessed a notable rise within the LGBTQ+ community. GHB is a substrate of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) and exhibits nonlinear toxicokinetics, characterized by saturable metabolism, absorption, and renal reabsorption. This study investigates the impact of exogenous testosterone administration on GHB toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics, exploring the potential of MCT1 inhibition as a strategy to counteract toxicity. Ovariectomized (OVX) females and castrated (CST) male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with testosterone or placebo for 21 days. GHB was administered at two doses (1000 mg/kg or 1500 mg/kg i.v.), and the MCT1 inhibitor AR-C 155858 (1 mg/kg i.v.) was administered 5 min after GHB (1500 mg/kg i.v.) administration. Plasma and urine were collected up to 8 h post-dose, and GHB concentrations were quantified via a validated LC/MS/MS assay. Sleep time (sedative/hypnotic effect) was utilized as the toxicodynamic endpoint. Testosterone treatment significantly affected GHB toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. Testosterone-treated CST rats exhibited significantly lower renal clearance, higher AUC, and increased sedative effect, while testosterone-treated OVX rats demonstrated higher metabolic clearance. AR-C 155858 treatment led to an increase in GHB renal and total clearance together with an improvement in sedative/hypnotic effect. In conclusion, exogenous testosterone treatment induces significant alterations in GHB toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics, and MCT inhibition can serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for GHB overdose in both cisgender and transgender male populations."

The authors illustrate what constitutes as gender-affirming nursing encounters by characterizing gender-affirming approaches to conducting and documenting a nursing assessment and describing techniques to overcome institutional-level challenges that may hinder a nurse's ability to establish gender-affirming therapeutic relationships with TNGE people. The authors also provide strategies that nurses can use to improve their health care organization and interprofessional collaborative practice to create psychologically and physically safe health care spaces for TNGE people."
79,"The Argentine Osteoporosis Society convened renowned specialists in the care of transgender people to prepare the first local position on the evaluation of bone health in this population. Law 26.743 on ""Gender Identity"" recognize all identities and guarantees free care throughout the health system. The impact of different gender affirmation treatments on bone mass has been topic of international debate. To date the evidence remains limited and different societies have issued suggestions and recommendations. For this reason, we believe it is relevant to mention our experience, capturing through this document a series of suggestions to be used in medical care."
80,"Leaving nobody behind in the fight to end the HIV epidemic as a public health threat depends on addressing inequities in optimal HIV outcomes. Consistently overlooked in research, policy and programming are young lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning and intersex (LGBTQI+) people who are living with HIV. This study engaged young LGBTQI+ people in Zimbabwe to better understand their experiences of living with HIV and the support they need. Between September 2022 and February 2023, we conducted qualitative research with 14 LGBTQI+ young people (18-24 years), (two focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with 5/14). All 14 participants were accessing a LGBTQI+ HIV support group at Zvandiri ('As I Am'), a well-established community-based HIV program. We conducted thematic analysis and key findings informed the collaborative development of internal activities to further enhance inclusivity of LGBTQI+ young people within Zvandiri's programs. There was consensus among participants that being LGBTQI+ and living with HIV leads to ""double stigma and double trouble"", involving physical and verbal harassment, social exclusion and family rejection. Participants concealed their LGBTQI+ identity and HIV status in most situations, and many withheld their HIV status in LGBTQI+ social spaces, including community-led LGBTQI+ services. This negatively impacted their psychosocial well-being and social connectedness. Participants described positive experiences of Zvandiri. Interacting with others living with HIV in a destigmatising environment promoted self-acceptance. However, reflecting their prevailing experiences, participants were cautious about revealing their sexuality and/or gender identity at Zvandiri outside of their support group. Ensuring equitable access to HIV care, including mental health support, relies on understanding the challenges experienced by those most marginalised. Critically important is understanding the impact of intersectional stigma on LGBTQI+ young peoples' social lives, and their access to services. Community-based HIV support programs are well-positioned to support and advance this group's health rights."

85,"Cabotegravir long-acting (CAB-LA) administered every 2 months was approved in the USA as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for individuals at risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection based on the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 083 and HPTN 084 clinical trials, which demonstrated superior reduction in HIV-1 acquisition compared with daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) in men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender women (TGW), and cisgender women. A decision-analytic model was developed to assess the lifetime cost-effectiveness of initiating CAB-LA versus generic oral FTC/TDF for HIV PrEP in the USA from a healthcare sector perspective."
86,"Sexual and gender minority (SGM) people, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer individuals, are a diverse population with a wide spectrum of gynecologic needs. Institutionalized cisheteronormativity, stigmatization, lack of provider training, and fear of discrimination contribute to health disparities in this patient population. In this article, we review key topics in the gynecologic care of SGM patients and provide strategies to enable gynecologists to provide SGM people with equitable and inclusive full spectrum reproductive health care."
87,"People from the LGBT+ community often face unique healthcare disparities, including barriers to accessing appropriate and respectful care. The purpose of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the Polish-language version of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Development of Clinical Skills Scale (LGBT- DOCSS-PL). Before testing its psychometric properties, the LGBT-DOCSS was translated and adapted from the original English version into Polish. Subsequently, we tested the instrument's psychometric properties on a sample of 415 participants. In addition, internal consistency of the questionnaire was checked with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Cronbach's alpha together with discriminative power index were uses as internal consistency measures. There were more female than male participants (58%). More than 57% of the participants were heterosexual and the average age of the respondents was approximately 30 years. The internal consistency of the Polish version and its domains was strong with an overall Cronbach's alpha of 0.789. The alpha ranges for each subscale domains were between 0.780-0.824. The McDonald's omega coefficient was 0.86. The Polish version of the LGBT-DOCSS-PL has good properties of factorial validity."
88,"Interactive communications technologies facilitate identity formation and socio-sexual connection among transgender and gender-diverse young people. However, within their communities, variations in technology use along ethno-racial, sexual and gendered lines, and as facilitators of sexual resilience during the early COVID-19 pandemic, remain under-studied. Among  = 230 transgender and gender-diverse young adults, surveyed between October 2020 and September 2021, latent class analyses characterised participants by preferred functional affordances, such as finding dates, sex and friends (Model 1), and by simultaneous account-keeping across social, dating and 'hookup' apps (Model 2). Werron and Ringel's typology of pandemic practices characterised qualitative descriptions of sexual decision-making attributed to COVID-19. Both fit indices favoured two-class solutions. Model 1 detected an  = 89, 43% 'high interactive communications technologies-enabled intimacy' (versus 'low technology-enabled intimacy') class, in which digitally mediated friendships, dates, sexual encounters and gay/lesbian sexualities, predominated. An  = 38, 17% 'high socio-sexual polymedia' (versus 'low polymedia') class in Model 2 was characterised by simultaneous social media, 'hookup' and dating app usage. 'High' subgroups saw statistically significant reductions in sexual partners, with the high polymedia class also associated with reductions in HIV testing. Qualitative results contextualised these reductions as, predominantly, 'responsive' pandemic practices: reactions to stay-at-home orders."
89,"From 2016 to 2021, the volume of peer-reviewed publications related to tobacco has experienced a significant increase. This presents a considerable challenge in efficiently summarizing, synthesizing, and disseminating research findings, especially when it comes to addressing specific target populations, such as the LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, Two Spirit, and other persons who identify as part of this community) populations."
90,"The rising self-identifying lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) population makes understanding the unique health care needs of sexual and gender minoritized patients an urgent one. The interaction between minority stress and cardiovascular disease has been well described among underrepresented minoritized populations. The underrepresentation of minoritized populations in clinical research is partly responsible for worse cardiovascular outcomes in these populations. The absence of sexual orientation and gender identity and expression (SOGIE) data makes it difficult to understand the cardiovascular health of LGBTQ+ adults, thereby widening health care disparities in this population. Advancing cardiovascular health equity for LGBTQ+ patients must begin with careful and accurate SOGIE data collection."
91,"Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth with chronic pain may be at unique risk for psychological distress and associated functional impairment, yet research on the intersection of chronic pain and gender identity is lacking. In a retrospective chart review of 491 participants admitted to a pediatric intensive interdisciplinary pain treatment (IIPT) program in the midwestern United States over an approximately 4-year period, 6.11% were TGD. TGD participants who completed the IIPT program reported significant and large improvements in anxiety, depression, pain catastrophizing, and functional ability. At baseline, TGD participants presented as more emotionally distressed and functionally impaired compared to age-matched, cisgender peers. When accounting for baseline scores, TGD participants who completed the IIPT program reported similar scores to cisgender peers at discharge, yet TGD youth were significantly less likely than cisgender peers to complete the IIPT program. Future directions and implications for clinical practice are discussed."

93,"Androgens are important sex hormones in both men and women and are supplemented when endogenous levels are low, for gender transitioning, or to increase libido. Androgens also circulate at higher levels in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, a condition that increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases including hypertension and arterial stiffness. Since our previous work shows an important role for the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in arterial stiffness, we hypothesized that other hormones including androgens may impact arterial stiffness in female mice via downregulation of GPER."
94,"Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals are at risk for breast cancer, but are less likely to undergo screening mammograms and appear to suffer poorer cancer-related outcomes than cisgender women. Gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) may be lifesaving for TGD individuals from the perspective of affirming their core identities; however, the effects of GAHT on cancer development, progression, and outcomes are poorly understood."
95,"Violence and harassment toward transgender women are associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and social support might moderate such association. This analysis explored the association between certain forms of violence and harassment and suicidal ideation and moderation by social support. Better understanding of these associations could guide mental health services and structural interventions appropriate to lived experiences of transgender women. This cross-sectional analysis used data from CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance Among Transgender Women. During 2019-2020, transgender women were recruited via respondent-driven sampling from seven urban areas in the United States for an HIV biobehavioral survey. The association between experiencing certain forms of violence and harassment (i.e., gender-based verbal and physical abuse or harassment, physical intimate partner abuse or harassment, and sexual violence) and suicidal ideation was measured using adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% CIs generated from log-linked Poisson regression models controlling for respondent-driven sampling design and confounders. To examine moderation, the extents of social support from family, friends, and significant others were assessed for interaction with certain forms of violence and harassment; if p interaction was <0.05, stratified adjusted prevalence ratios were presented. Among 1,608 transgender women, 59.7% experienced certain forms of violence and harassment and 17.7% reported suicidal ideation during the past 12 months; 75.2% reported high social support from significant others, 69.4% from friends, and 46.8% from family. Experiencing certain forms of violence and harassment and having low-moderate social support from any source was associated with higher prevalence of suicidal ideation. Social support from family moderated the association between experiencing certain forms of violence and harassment and suicidal ideation (p interaction = 0.01); however, even in the presence of high family social support, experiencing certain forms of violence and harassment was associated with higher prevalence of suicidal ideation. Social support did not completely moderate the positive association between experiencing violence and harassment and suicidal ideation. Further understanding of the social support dynamics of transgender women might improve the quality and use of social support. Policymakers and health care workers should work closely with transgender women communities to reduce the prevalence of violence, harassment, and suicide by implementing integrated, holistic, and transinclusive approaches."
96,"Transgender women experience high prevalence of homelessness, which can affect their likelihood of acquiring HIV infection and can lead to poor medical outcomes. CDC analyzed data from the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance Among Transgender Women to identify whether personal characteristics and social factors affecting transgender women were associated with duration of homelessness during the past 12 months. Longer duration and chronic homelessness might indicate greater unmet needs, which increases their likelihood for acquiring HIV infection. Ordinal logistic regression was conducted to calculate adjusted prevalence odds ratios and 95% CIs for transgender women from seven urban areas in the United States experiencing homelessness 30-365 nights, 1-29 nights, and zero nights during the past 12 months. Among 1,566 transgender women, 9% reported 1-29 nights homeless and 31% reported 30-365 nights homeless during the past 12 months. Among participants who reported physical intimate partner violence or forced sex, 50% and 47%, respectively, reported experiencing 30-365 nights homeless. Furthermore, 55% who had been evicted or denied housing because of their gender identity and 58% who had been incarcerated during the past year experienced 30-365 nights homeless. The odds of transgender women experiencing longer duration of homelessness was associated with being younger and having a disability; higher psychological distress scores were associated with longer duration of homelessness. Analysis of social determinants of health found transgender women experiencing longer homelessness to be less educated, living below the Federal poverty level, and having lower social support. Therefore, focusing on HIV prevention and interventions addressing housing instability to reduce the duration of homelessness among transgender women is important. Further, integrating housing services with behavioral health services and clinical care, specifically designed for transgender women, could reduce HIV acquisition risk and improve HIV infection outcomes."
97,"Certain transgender women who seek gender-affirming hormone treatment (GAHT) face economic and social barriers that limit or prevent access to medically supervised GAHT. Transgender women facing such barriers might acquire GAHT without prescription, potentially without proper dosage, administration, and health monitoring in the absence of medical supervision. For this report, survey data were analyzed from 1,165 transgender women in seven urban areas in the United States to examine associations between self-reported use of nonprescription GAHT and known correlates of nonprescription GAHT, including cost, insurance coverage for GAHT, homelessness, receiving money or drugs in exchange for sex during the past 12 months (exchange sex), lack of comfort discussing gender with provider, and lack of health care use. After controlling for complex sampling design, transgender women who reported recent health care use or insurance coverage for GAHT were less likely to report nonprescription GAHT, and those reporting recent exchange sex or recent homelessness were more likely to report nonprescription GAHT. Findings suggest that transgender women were more likely to use GAHT without a prescription in situations of economic and social marginalization (e.g., disengagement from health care, lack of insurance or trans-specific health care, homelessness, or engagement in sex work). Public health professionals can use these results to design effective interventions to facilitate prescribed hormone use among transgender women in the United States, although access to housing, trans-affirming health care, and insurance coverage might be needed to prevent nonprescription use."
98,"Psychosocial and structural syndemic conditions, including polydrug use and experiencing homelessness, frequently co-occur and might jointly increase HIV risk. Limited studies have assessed racial and ethnic differences in exposure to syndemic conditions and behaviors associated with HIV transmission among transgender women. This report examines the relation between syndemic conditions and condomless anal intercourse (CAI) among transgender women in seven urban areas in the United States to develop HIV prevention interventions for transgender women. During 2019-2020, transgender women in seven urban areas were recruited using respondent-driven sampling for a biobehavioral survey. Reported syndemic conditions (psychosocial: polydrug use, sexual violence, and psychological distress; structural: homelessness, incarceration, and exchange sex) were summed to create a syndemic score. Using modified Poisson regression to account for RDS, the study assessed whether the strength of the association between syndemic score and CAI differed by race and ethnicity. To assess additive interaction, the relative excess prevalence owing to interaction (REPI) and 95% CIs for selected pairs of syndemic conditions on CAI prevalence stratified by race and ethnicity were estimated. Of 1,348 transgender women (Black = 546, White = 176, and Hispanic = 626), 55% reported CAI; and 24% reported ≥3 syndemic conditions. Reporting additional syndemic conditions was associated with CAI for White, Hispanic, and Black participants. The association was significantly stronger for White than Black and Hispanic participants. Limited significant superadditive interactions were found, although the majority were between structural syndemic conditions. Racial and ethnic differences in REPI estimates were observed. Reporting more syndemic conditions was associated with increased CAI across racial and ethnic groups, demonstrating that HIV prevention efforts for transgender women should address structural and psychosocial syndemic conditions. Results differed by race and ethnicity, indicating that syndemic-focused interventions for transgender women should be tailored to racial and ethnic groups."
99,"Transgender women experience discrimination in many settings, including in employment. Because employment and health insurance are intertwined in the United States, employment discrimination might be related to lower health insurance coverage and health care use, including gender-affirming care. This analysis used data from transgender women (N = 1,608) in seven urban areas in the United States collected during 2019-2020 to present the prevalence of six discrimination types (employment, housing, bathroom, businesses, health care, and abuse) and to measure the association between employment discrimination (defined as trouble getting a job or fired due to being transgender) and sociodemographic characteristics, health care access, and health care use. Log-linked Poisson regression models were conducted to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% CIs. Seven in 10 transgender women experienced at least one type of discrimination during the past 12 months. During the same period, 9.9% of transgender women were fired and 32.4% had trouble getting a job because of being transgender. Employment discrimination was associated with younger age and lower socioeconomic status. Having trouble getting a job was associated with health care access and health care use factors, including having no health insurance or having Medicaid only, having an unmet medical need because of cost, never having transgender-specific care, and having an unmet need for gender-affirming procedures. These findings suggest that employment discrimination contributes to transgender women's economic marginalization and their ability to obtain adequate health insurance coverage and achieve their transition goals. These findings might help guide efforts that protect transgender women's right to pursue their work, health, and life goals without discrimination."
100,"CDC recommends pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for transgender women who have sex with men and who report sexual behaviors that place them at substantial ongoing risk for HIV exposure, including those who engage in nonsterile syringe sharing. Providing transgender women with access to PrEP is a critical strategy for reducing HIV acquisition and ending the HIV epidemic. Survey results from the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance Among Transgender Women were used to assess characteristics associated with past-year discussions of PrEP with a health care provider and PrEP use. Bivariate analyses were conducted to assess the association between covariates (sociodemographic, HIV-associated characteristics, and gender-affirming care) and each outcome, accounting for sampling design. All covariates that were statistically significant at p<0.05 in the bivariate analyses were included in multivariate models, and manual backward elimination was used to obtain final models that retained statistically significant covariates. Among 902 transgender women from seven urban areas in the United States without HIV infection in the analyses, 57% had recently discussed PrEP with a health care provider, and 32% recently had used PrEP. In the final multivariate model, the following subgroups of transgender women were more likely to report recent PrEP use: those who identified as Black or African American or Hispanic or Latina, had two or more sex partners in the past 12 months, had condomless sex in the past 12 months, reported their last sex partner was infected with HIV, had condomless sex with their last sex partner whose HIV status was positive or unknown, ever had transgender-specific health care, and currently had transgender-specific health insurance coverage. Participants who were less likely to have recently used PrEP were those who wanted to but were not currently taking hormones and those aged <40 years. Providing increased access to gender-affirming care and training health care providers who serve transgender women to incorporate PrEP into existing services might increase PrEP use among transgender women."
101,"To address healthcare disparities among transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adolescents, we examined vaccination coverage in those receiving gender-affirming care."
102,"Despite significant strides in reducing gender disparities over the past decades, women still face disparities in several domains. While extensive research has explored the various consequences of gender inequalities for women, this study ( = 493 participants) delves into a less-explored dimension, investigating whether and how perceiving gender inequalities is associated with attitudes toward minorities. Drawing on relative deprivation theory and intra-minority solidarity research, we examined the relationship between women's perceptions of gender inequalities-spanning workplace inequality, domestic inequality, sexual harassment, and social expectations-and attitudes toward gays and lesbians, transgender women, and immigrants. We also explored whether indignation, arising from recognizing unjust circumstances, mediated these relationships, and the moderating role of perceived friends' support for gender equality. The results of the path analyses unveiled a nuanced relationship. While women who were more aware of gender inequalities exhibited more positive attitudes toward gays and lesbians and transgender women, no such relationship was observed regarding immigrants. Indignation and perceived friends' support for gender equality were key factors in fostering positive intergroup attitudes. Regarding their moderating role, perceived social norms only influenced the relationship between indignation and attitudes toward gays and lesbians. These findings shed light on the intricate interplay between gender inequalities and minority group attitudes. Recognizing the multifaceted nature of gender inequality and its emotional impact can catalyze promoting coalitional attitudes and collective action among disadvantaged groups. The study also underscores the potential of close groups' norms in promoting positive intergroup attitudes, warranting further exploration."
103,"The measurement of sexual and gender identity in the United States has been evolving to generate more precise demographic estimates of the population and a better understanding of health and well-being. Younger cohorts of sexual- and gender-diverse adults are endorsing identities outside of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) labels. Current population-level surveys often include a category such as ""something else"" without providing further details, and doing so inadequately captures these diverse identities. In this research note, our analysis of the most recent federal data source to incorporate sexual and gender identity measures-the Household Pulse Survey-reveals that younger birth cohorts are more likely to select ""something else"" for their sexual identity and ""none of these"" for their gender identity. The observed sexual and gender identity response patterns across birth cohorts underscore the importance of developing and applying new strategies to directly measure sexual- and gender-diverse adults who identify with identities outside of those explicitly captured on surveys. The integration of sexual and gender identity measures in population-level surveys carries broader implications for civil rights and for addressing health inequities and therefore must be responsive to cohort differences in identification."
104,"Correction of lower face asymmetry still remains challenging in maxillofacial surgery. This report describes techniques for the lateral transposition of the symphyseal segment to restore lower face symmetry while maintaining gender-related features in cis- and transgender patients.  A retrospective review of medical records of 31 patients who attended for esthetic corrective surgery after orthodontic camouflage or orthognathic treatment, or during facial feminization of the lower face between June 2021 and June 2023 was performed.  All patients underwent lateralization genioplasty (with or without advancement or setback), either with or without narrowing T-osteotomy supplemented with necessary procedures in order to obtain proper facial balance and desired esthetical effects, such as bichectomy, liposuction, and face and neck lift. The mean asymmetry of the chin was 5.15 mm and was surgically corrected either by single segment lateralization or T-shape narrowing genioplasty depending on the gender and esthetical requirements. No complications were reported.  Lateral shift genioplasty serves as a powerful tool in primary and secondary corrective surgery for lower face asymmetry that maintains gender-specific facial features. It may serve either as an additive to orthodontic camouflage or a way to correct previous orthognathic surgery pitfalls. The surgeon performing esthetic genioplasty associated with gender-specific expectations must be trained in facelift and facial liposculpting techniques in order to provide the best results and properly choose the right procedures for the right patients."
105,": Upper-face feminization is a frequently executed procedure in sexual reassignment surgery, owing to its ability to influence gender identity through adjustments to the hairline, forehead, and peri-orbital area. The procedure includes reducing the hairline, lifting the brows, shaving the orbital region, and applying specific techniques to reduce the frontal bone. This research aims to assess the outcomes, results, and potential complications associated with this surgery among transgender patients. : Retrospective review of medical records of 20 patients who attended for facial feminization surgery of the upper face between June 2022 and June 2023, analyzing the previously performed procedures, complications and revision surgery outcomes, and first-time procedures. A literature review was performed for similar studies. : 20 patients were included in the study. Among the cohort treated elsewhere ( = 11), the primary complaint was insufficient browbone reduction and anterior frontal sinus table setback. They underwent poorly performed Type 1 reduction when full forehead reconstruction (Type 3/4) was indicated ( = 3), or no reduction was performed during hairline advancement ( = 4). Type 3 forehead reduction with orbital shaving and hairline advancement with simultaneous temporal browlift was most commonly performed in both revision and first-time surgical upper face feminization ( = 15) (75%). Type 1 osteoplasty was performed in four patients (10%), one Type 3 revision surgery was performed after insufficient Type 3 reduction, and one case of shock-induced alopecia was reported, treated with PRP/peptides and a FUE hair graft. : The author's preferred technique, 'whole-in-one' upper face feminization by modified bi-coronal incision with frontal trichophytic hyper-beveled incision, provides sufficient insight into the frontal bone and orbital region, the desired forehead osteoplasty and the most efficient insight into the temporal area, enabling safe dissection between fasciae, ligamentous adhesion removal, and periosteal attachment, providing full soft and hard tissue feminization. Nevertheless, feminization procedures should be meticulously planned, and all concerning issues should be addressed during the first surgery in order to prevent revisions, complications, and patient dissatisfaction."
106,"(1) Importance of problem: Breast cancer accounted for 685,000 deaths globally in 2020, and half of all cases occur in women with no specific risk factor besides gender and age group. During the last four decades, we have seen a 40% reduction in age-standardized breast cancer mortality and have also witnessed a reduction in the medium age at diagnosis, which in turn means that the number of mastectomies performed for younger women increased, raising the need for adequate breast reconstructive surgery. Advances in oncological treatment have made it possible to limit the extent of what represents radical surgery for breast cancer, yet in the past decade, we have seen a marked trend toward mastectomies in breast-conserving surgery-eligible patients. Prophylactic mastectomies have also registered an upward trend. This trend together with new uses for breast reconstruction like chest feminization in transgender patients has increased the need for breast reconstruction surgery. (2) Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze the types of reconstructive procedures, their indications, their limitations, their functional results, and their safety profiles when used during the integrated treatment plan of the oncologic patient. (3) Methods: We conducted an extensive literature review of the main reconstructive techniques, especially the autologous procedures; summarized the findings; and presented a few cases from our own experience for exemplification of the usage of breast reconstruction in oncologic patients. (4) Conclusions: Breast reconstruction has become a necessary step in the treatment of most breast cancers, and many reconstructive techniques are now routinely practiced. Microsurgical techniques are considered the ""gold standard"", but they are not accessible to all services, from a technical or financial point of view, so pediculated flaps remain the safe and reliable option, along with alloplastic procedures, to improve the quality of life of these patients."
107,"The security measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 emergency have caused complex consequences. The aim of the present study is to examine the repercussions of the pandemic on individuals belonging to gender identity minority groups, who have experienced heightened levels of stress in comparison to the general population."
108,Substance use and mental distress are known barriers to HIV care engagement among trans women. Less is known about access and utilization of mental health and substance use care among trans women and the relationship between unmet behavioral health needs and HIV viral suppression. We examined the relationship between mental health and substance use on HIV viral load among trans women living with HIV. We also examined the relationship between mental health and substance use services needs with HIV care engagement and having a detectable viral load by comparing engagement in care cascades.
109,"Gender dysphoria is socially more visible and discussed today, but still underdiagnosed. It refers to distress and/or impaired function caused by inconsistency between the sex assigned at birth and gender identification. Clinical manifestations are variable. Lack of training and investment in gender issues make the diagnosis and management in primary care complex, particularly in conservative and isolated communities, with poor access to information and specialized health services. We describe the diagnosis of gender dysphoria and use of a patient centered multidisciplinary and family approach in a 12-year-old rural born adolescent, assigned female at birth. Our aim is to raise awareness of early symptoms and signs of gender dysphoria and problems faced by transgender people and their families during childhood, leading to gender dysphoria, and we hope our successful approach might improve healthcare provision for these patients, particularly in rural areas."
110,"Maltreatment based on race, sex, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or other sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ+) status is a significant life stressor, potentially independent of whether it can be categorized as a , fifth edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR) trauma. Yet there is a relative lack of research systematically examining these events, their intersectionality, and links to posttraumatic stress (PTS). The purpose of this study was to develop a comprehensive measure of social discrimination and maltreatment (SDM) and to examine whether these events can serve as potential traumatic stressors, above-and-beyond classic trauma exposure."
111,Trans and gender-diverse people visiting pharmacies may not always receive optimum care due to pharmacists' lack of knowledge and confidence to provide such care. This situation prompts a need for training.
112,"University education is undergoing a paradigm shift towards active methodologies, such as virtual reality and training videos, which have proven to be valuable resources, especially in the health sciences. The scarcity of existing research on the topic prompted us to conduct this study, which seeks to measure the knowledge gained from the aforementioned tools by users, their level of satisfaction with them, and their perceived utility."
113,"Gender euphoria (i.e., a positive feeling associated with one's gender identity, expression, or affirmation) is widely discussed among transgender and gender diverse (hereafter referred to as trans) individuals. However, as a construct, gender euphoria has never been formally measured and has rarely been empirically studied. Hence, this protocol paper illustrates our process for developing and validating a new tool to measure gender euphoria, known as the Gender Euphoria Scale (GES), for use with trans populations."

115,"Diagnostic of transsexualism and gender incongruence are terms to describe individuals whose self-identity does not match their sex assignment at birth. A transgender woman is an individual assigned male at birth (AMAB) on the basis of the external or internal genitalia who identifies and lives as a woman. In recent decades, a significant increase in the number of transgender people has been reported. Although, its etiology is unknown, biological, anatomical, genetic, environmental and cultural factors have been suggested to contribute to gender variation. In XY animals, it has been shown that environmental endocrine disruptors, through their anti-androgenic activity, induce a female identity. In this work, we described four XY individuals who were exposed in utero to the xenoestrogen diethylstilbesterol (DES) and were part of the French HHORAGES cohort. They all reported a female transgender identity starting from childhood and adolescence. This high prevalence of male to female transgenderism (1.58%) in our cohort of 253 DES sons suggests that exposure to chemicals with xenoestrogen activity during fetal life may affect the male sex identity and behavior."
116,Transgender women (TW) experience significant inequities in healthcare access and health disparities compared to cisgender populations. Access to non-transition related healthcare is understudied among TW. We aimed to assess the association between access to care and gender minority stress and resilience factors among TW living with and without HIV in eastern and southern United States.
117,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Asia-Pacific region have a disproportionately high burden of HIV infection compared with the general population. Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV is highly effective at preventing new HIV infections, the cost-effectiveness of PrEP for MSM in different countries in the Asia-Pacific region with varying PrEP coverage and HIV testing frequencies remains unstudied. We aimed to analyse the economic and health benefits of long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA) compared with oral PrEP in high-income countries and low-income and middle-income countries within the Asia-Pacific region."
118,Puberty blockade and gender affirming hormone therapy can impair fertility. Counseling on fertility preservation is important prior to initiation of therapy. The aim of our study was to assess tanner staging and the presence of virilizing secondary sex characteristics at the time of sperm collection and to correlate the viability of sperm with the tanner staging and degree of virilization.
119,"Family physicians are uniquely poised to provide gender-affirming care (GAC) to transgender and nonbinary patients, but current undergraduate and graduate medical education in this field is lacking. Little is known about the impact of various GAC curricula on the clinical care provided by resident physicians. We aimed to assess the efficacy of a multimodal educational framework on the quality of GAC provided by residents at a large academic family medicine program."
120,"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals in most countries face strong stigma and often rely on affirmative mental health care to foster coping and resilience. We tested an LGBTQ-affirmative mental health training for psychologists and psychiatrists by comparing in-person versus online modalities and the added benefit of supervision. Participants were randomized to a two-day training either in-person ( = 58) or via live-stream online broadcast ( = 55). Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 5, 10, and 15 months posttraining. Optional monthly online supervision was offered ( = 47) from months 5 to 15. Given the substantial need for LGBTQ-affirmative expertise in high-stigma contexts, the training took place in Romania, a Central-Eastern European country with some of the highest LGBTQ stigma in Europe. Participants ( age = 35.1) were mostly cisgender female (88%) and heterosexual (85%). Trainees, regardless of whether in-person or online, reported significant decreases from baseline to 15-month follow-up in implicit and explicit bias and significant increases in LGBTQ-affirmative clinical skills, beliefs, and behaviors. LGBTQ-affirmative practice intentions and number of LGBTQ clients did not change. Participants who attended at least one supervision session demonstrated greater reductions in explicit bias and increases in LGBTQ-affirmative behaviors from baseline to 15-month follow-up than participants who did not attend supervision. LGBTQ-affirmative mental health training can efficiently and sustainably improve LGBTQ competence and reduce provider bias in high-stigma contexts. Future research can identify additional ways to encourage mental health providers' outreach to LGBTQ clients in need of affirmative care."
121,"How gender-affirming treatments (GAT) influence the experienced sexuality of transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary (TGNB) individuals remains understudied. The aim of this research was to discern factors contributing to a satisfying sexual experience for TGNB individuals, explore the influence of GAT on this process, and identify potential areas for improvement in transition-related care. We conducted interviews with 21 participants at various stages of GAT. Participants identified as (trans)men (12), (trans)women (7), transgender (1), and genderqueer/gender non-conforming/non-binary (1). Thematic analysis was conducted and involved multiple researchers. Three themes emerged from the data: (i) the role sexuality plays in understanding and affirming one's gender, (ii) satisfaction with one's physical sexual function, (iii) positive communication about sex and its subsequent influence on relationships. Many participants associated satisfaction with physical sexual function with positive sexual experiences, often describing GAT-induced changes in sexual arousal, drive, and orgasm as gender-affirming. Emotional connection and affirmation from sexual partners also contributed to positive experiences. The ability to (re-)define what sex meant individually increased satisfaction levels. Moreover, understanding and affirming one's gender identity were closely related to a satisfactory sex life. This study offers valuable insights for healthcare providers working with TGNB individuals during GAT, particularly concerning their sexuality."
122,"Sexual and gender diverse people face intersecting factors affecting their well-being and livelihood. These include homophobic reactions, stigma or discrimination at the workplace and in healthcare facilities, economic vulnerability, lack of social support, and HIV. This study aimed to examine the association between such factors and symptoms of anxiety and depression among sexual and gender diverse people."
123,"In the late 2000s, LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and others) identities began to surface in Indian audiovisual marketing campaigns. By 2021, brands had produced at least 105 advertisements featuring LGBTQ+ identities. This research conducts an analysis of these campaigns, examining aspects such as their release date, featured characters, gender identity, sexual orientation, character age, narrative usage, genre, theme, and setting. The study reveals a substantial surge in advertising campaigns since 2018, with brands strategically launching them during Pride Month, Valentine's Day, and Women's Day. Characters embodying gay, lesbian, and transgender identities were most prevalent. Advertisements spotlighting gay, lesbian, or both gay and lesbian characters predominantly emphasised themes of love, featuring youthful characters and urban settings. In contrast, advertisements featuring transgender characters centred on human rights, with older characters and non-urban settings. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the number of LGBTQ+ marketing campaigns should continue to rise, diversifying character identities, ages, and settings while being released throughout the year."
124,"Infertility-the inability to achieve pregnancy despite ≥12 months of focused attempts to conceive-is experienced by 1 in 6 couples. Women typically carry a disproportionate share of the psychological burden associated with infertility, experiencing poor quality of life, and 30%-40% experiencing depressive mood or anxiety. Unfortunately, currently available psychological interventions targeting infertility-related distress are associated with modest effects."
125,"Disparities in youth homelessness by racial/ethnic, sexual, and gender identities are well documented, though this literature lacks specificity regarding intersectional social identities of youth who are most likely to experience homelessness. Population-based cross-sectional data on youth from the 2019 Minnesota Student Survey ( = 80,456) were used to examine the relationship between parent caring and intersections of minoritized identities that experience the highest prevalence of two distinct types of unaccompanied unstable housing with expanded categories of sexual and gender identities. Exhaustive chi-square automatic interaction detection models revealed that low parent caring was the most common predictor of unaccompanied homelessness and running away, but there was important variation among youth of color at the intersection of sexual and gender identities. The findings reveal a more complex story of disparities in unaccompanied unstable housing among youth with multiple marginalized social identities and highlight the need to create culturally informed prevention and intervention strategies for parents of LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning) youth of color. The implications for prevention and intervention among subgroups with the highest prevalence are discussed in the context of interlocking systems of power and oppression.

129,The purpose of this study was to calibrate an item set for a new version of the Communicative Participation Item Bank (CPIB) specifically for use with gender-diverse clients. This new version contains a new item stem as well as other minor wording changes from the original CPIB in order to be acceptable to gender-diverse respondents.
130,"Gender-affirming surgery is a medically necessary treatment for transgender and gender diverse patients experiencing gender dysphoria. Preliminary data demonstrate an association between gender-affirming surgery and improved mental health outcomes. Penile inversion vaginoplasty is the most frequently performed feminizing bottom surgery in transwomen. Importantly, complications associated with penile inversion vaginoplasty are not uncommon and can be life-threatening. Surgeons and other members of the health care team must be aware of these potential harms. However, there is a paucity of high-quality evidence reported in the literature about the management and breadth of complications regarding feminizing bottom surgery."
131,"Intimate partner sexual violence (IPSV) is a substantial public health issue faced by youth, with disparities along lines of race, gender, and sexual orientation. Using an intersectional framework, the current study describes the prevalence of self-reported IPSV victimization across intersecting social positions among adolescents. High school students who completed the 2019 Minnesota Student Survey were asked whether they had ever experienced IPSV. Using exhaustive Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detection (eCHAID), responses were modeled using five indicators: racial/ethnic identity, transgender/genderqueer/genderfluid identity, sex assigned at birth, sexual orientation, and school location. The prevalence of IPSV victimization within each end group identified by the eCHAID varied from 2.6% to 32.0%. The highest prevalence of IPSV among all students was observed in subgroups defined by multiple marginalized social positions; for example, 32.0% among lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, pansexual, or questioning (LGBQ+) students of color who were transgender, genderqueer, genderfluid or unsure of their gender, and assigned male at birth; 22.8% among LGBQ+ students assigned female at birth and enrolled in a Greater Minnesota (outside of the Twin Cities) school; and 22.2% among Native+ or missing race LGBQ+ students assigned female at birth and enrolled in a metropolitan school. Within the eCHAID decision tree, several subsamples of students were split into two more subsamples with a twofold or greater statistically significant difference in IPSV victimization prevalence between them. Findings from this study highlight notable disparities in the prevalence of IPSV victimization among Minnesota youth and demonstrate the importance of detailing the distribution of interpersonal violence outcomes across youth with multiple marginalized identities. Findings suggest that disparities reported along one categorical axis only may miss important nuances in how risk for IPSV is distributed. Population health researchers should utilize methods that allow for the explication of complex intersections that characterize individuals' social positions in estimating the prevalence of sexual violence."

133,"Studies of how gender-diverse individuals experience pregnancy, childbirth, and nursing remain few, mainly focus on the US and contain scarce information about mental health concerns peri-partum. This hinders informed reproductive health decisions and counseling. We used in-depth interviews to examine how gestational gender-diverse individuals in Sweden experience the process of planning and undergoing pregnancy, delivery, and nursing. In total, 12 participants, identifying on the masculine side of the gender spectrum or as non-binary, who had attended Swedish antenatal care and delivered a live birth, were included in the study. Data were analyzed using qualitative thematic content analysis. The analysis resulted in one overarching theme: sustaining gender congruence during pregnancy and three main categories: (1) considering pregnancy; (2) undergoing pregnancy and childbirth; and (3) postnatal reflections. The association between childbearing and being regarded as female permeated narratives. Participants renegotiated the feminine connotations of pregnancy, accessed gender-affirming treatment, and concealed their pregnancy to safeguard their gender congruence. Mis-gendering and breast enlargement triggered gender dysphoria. Social judgment, loneliness, information shortages, hormonal influence and cessation of testosterone increased gender dysphoria and strained their mental health. Depression exacerbated gender dysphoria and made it harder to claim one's gender identity. Dissociation was used to handle a feminized body, vaginal delivery, and nursing. Pregnancy was easier to envision and handle after masculinizing gender-affirming treatments. The results deepen the understanding of gender dysphoria and may be used to inform reproductive counseling and healthcare development. Research outcomes on mental health concerns provide a basis for further research."

141,"Transgender (trans) individuals experience intimate partner violence (IPV) at elevated levels compared to cisgender individuals. Traditional theoretical understandings of IPV as men's patriarchal domination of women, and later, broader theories in which IPV is conceptualized as the relatively privileged partner enacting domination over the relatively oppressed partner, do not fully capture the totality of IPV experiences, including how IPV is perpetrated against trans individuals. We conducted a systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis of the qualitative and theoretical literatures on IPV against trans individuals (N = 37 articles and books) to generate novel IPV theory inclusive of trans individuals' experiences. We identified five major themes: (1) societal context of IPV, (2) IPV tactics and types, (3) help-seeking, (4) consequences of IPV, and (5) proposed interventions for victims. Synthesizing across themes, we offer a novel theoretical model that demonstrates how abusers can leverage structural discrimination and vulnerabilities against trans victims, regardless of the abuser's own identities. We identify individual power and control tactics abusers use, including identifying a category of IPV that we term leveraging vulnerability, which involves abusers weaponizing their own vulnerabilities to avoid accountability. Reducing IPV in trans communities requires expanding current IPV theory to include trans victims, recognition of a wider range of abuse tactics, and structural interventions that promote the respectful treatment of trans individuals. Our theoretical model of IPV ""centers the margins"" to make trans victims' experiences, and indeed all victims whose experiences fall outside normative scripts, more legible."
142,"To understand barriers to seeking post-sexual assault services for students of color and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ+) students.  Qualitative interviews about campus and community resources for sexual and relationship violence were conducted with 29 undergraduate and graduate students who held diverse sexual, gender, and racial identities ( = 15 disclosed violence-related service-seeking).  Organized within trauma-informed care pillars, thematic coding revealed aspects of campus environment/culture that prevent students from accessing support including challenges identifying experiences as violence; limited cultural and identity-affirming care; limited clarity about resources; confidentiality concerns; difficulty accessing resources; and navigating resources alone. Suggestions to address concerns included regular prevention training; better coordinated care and systems with increased accountability, increased survivor support and peer support, and heightened transparency on websites/trainings about processes and confidentiality.  Findings suggest promising avenues to improve support, particularly for minoritized survivors of violence, at this campus."
143,"Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) employees encounter unique challenges in the workplace that are not shared with the rest of the working population. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of 58 empirical studies on the workplace experiences of TGD individuals published in peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and 2022. Using the Minority Stress Model as a theoretical framework, we classified the literature based on (a) the challenges that TGD employees face when navigating their gender identity at work, (b) the outcomes of minority stress processes, and (c) the mechanisms to ameliorate the impact of minority stressors. Findings suggest that TGD employees are exposed to various distal and proximal stress processes that negatively impact work outcomes and mental health, including discrimination or expectations of rejection. A key protective factor both at the organizational and interpersonal level is support, including inclusive policy development and coworker support. At the intrapersonal level, adaptive coping strategies and an integrated minority identity can countervail the impact of minority stressors. Future research should further examine intrapersonal variables while leveraging broader intersectional and international samples. Practitioners are advised to proactively and continuously review their nondiscrimination policies and practices to promote employee wellbeing and positive work outcomes."
144,"The study aims at assessing gender and sexuality characteristics (GSC) in perception, attitude, and social intimacy among Sinophone youth toward transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) people. Based on an internet survey with 3 825 valid questionnaires, we distinguished the general public into TGNC, cisgender heterosexual, and cisgender non-heterosexual individuals. Then we classified TGNC individuals into trans females, trans males, and non-binary/genderqueer people and cisgender individuals into cisgender females and cisgender males. The chi-square test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multiple linear regression were used. We found that the evident gender and sexuality disparities in perception, attitude, and social intimacy toward TGNC individuals exist both in and out of TGNC individuals. Negative perceptions and attitudes as well as alienated social intimacy were most pronounced among cisgender heterosexual people (Chi-square test, one-way ANOVA, and multiple linear regression: all  < .001). Cisgender females exhibit higher levels of supportiveness compared to cisgender males. Trans females were the most positive while they also had more concerns regarding public space and gender expression-related issues. The findings are practical for community-based advocacy for raising public awareness of the presences and experiences of TGNC people in Sinophone societies."
145,"Sexual assault (SA) is experienced by a substantial proportion of emerging adult college students and is associated with elevated rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use. This study examines the mediating role of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in the associations among SA severity, drinking to cope with anxiety, and average weekly drinks while considering the moderating roles of gender identity and sexual orientation."
146,"Although the term homosexuality was removed from the International Classification of Diseases and trans identities from mental disorders, these classifications promote the pathologizing of homosexuality. The direct consequence is discrimination, which adds to the difficulty in carrying out accurate information related to the LGBT population and makes it very difficult to organize public policies suited to their needs. An important issue is related to the limited access of that population to assisted reproduction techniques, when compared to traditional families. The desire for same sex couples and transgender persons to have biological children is reportedly the same as for cisgender persons, but parenthood can be a much greater endeavor both medically and psychologically for them. The right to health includes freedom to control one's health and body, including sexual and reproductive issues. Despite these difficulties, we are living in a period of great social progress that increases access to assisted reproduction among novel patient populations. With legalization of gay marriage, individuals and couples who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, may seek to begin or expand their families with assisted reproduction technologies. Therefore, the aim of this review was to assist in the restructuring of healthcare services, routines and procedures, mainly related to reproductive medicine, in order to promote changes in values based on respect for differences. In conclusion, the healthcare personnel of fertility centers should undergo specific training and preparations to meet the specific demands of the LGBT patient population and to overcome communication barriers."
147,"This was a retrospective cohort study. Algorithms were developed to identify a cohort of people who were trans and gender diverse (PTGD) among provincial-level administrative health databases (physician, hospital, emergency department, and pharmacy) from April 1, 2012 to September 30, 2020. Then, healthcare usage was compared between the identified cohort and the general population. There were 6466 unique individuals identified in the cohort, out of a total population of 1.2 million Saskatchewan residents (~0.5%). They had a mean age of 42.5 (SD 17.7) years. 1946 (30.1%) had a female sex marker and 4560 (69.9%) had a male sex marker, which may not indicate their lived gender. The cohort had increased healthcare usage 2 years prior to their index date, compared to the general population, which continued to rise to 1 year past their index date across physician, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. The results for drugs were mixed. The percentage of PTGD identified in Saskatchewan was comparable to other studies. Healthcare utilization among the cohort was higher than the general population. Further research could use external data sources to validate and improve the cohort identification methods. The large majority of individuals with a male sex marker deserves further investigation."
148,"Implicit biases may negatively influence healthcare providers' behaviors toward patients from historically marginalized communities, impacting providers' communication style, clinical decision-making, and delivery of quality care. Existing interventions to mitigate negative experiences of implicit biases are primarily designed to increase recognition and management of stereotypes and prejudices through provider-facing tools and resources. However, there is a gap in understanding and designing interventions from patient perspectives. We conducted seven participatory co-design workshops with 32 Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning (LGBTQ+), and Queer, Transgender, Black, Indigenous, People of Color (QTBIPOC) individuals to design patient-centered interventions that help them address and recover from provider implicit biases in primary care. Participants designed four types of solutions: accountability measures, real-time correction, patient enablement tools,  provider resources. These informatics interventions extend the research on implicit biases in healthcare through inclusion of valuable, firsthand patient perspectives and experiences."
149,Previous meta-analyses of psychological interventions for adult post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) did not investigate whether efficacy is diminished in individuals with PTSD related to multiple (vs single) traumatic events. We aimed to assess whether treatment efficacy would be lower in randomised controlled trials involving multiple-event-related PTSD versus single-event-related PTSD.

154,"Self-reported sexual orientation of transgender individuals occasionally changes over transition. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested the hypothesis that neural and behavioral patterns of sexual arousal in transgender individuals would shift from the assigned to the experienced gender (e.g., trans women's responses becoming more dissimilar to those of cis men and more similar to those of cis women). To this aim, trans women (N = 12) and trans men (N = 20) as well as cisgender women (N = 24) and cisgender men (N = 14) rated visual stimuli showing male-female, female-female or male-male intercourse for sexual arousal before and after four months of gender-affirming hormone therapy. A Bayesian framework allowed us to incorporate previous behavioral findings. The hypothesized changes could indeed be observed in the behavioral responses with the strongest results for trans men and female-female scenes. Activation of the ventral striatum supported our hypothesis only for female-female scenes in trans women. The respective application or depletion of androgens in trans men and trans women might partly explain this observation. The prominent role of female-female stimuli might be based on the differential responses they elicit in cis women and men or, in theory, the controversial concept of autogynephilia. We show that correlates of sexual arousal in transgender individuals might change in the direction of the experienced gender. Future investigations should elucidate the mechanistic role of sex hormones and the cause of the differential neural and behavioral findings.The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02715232), March 22, 2016."
155,"In the United States, approximately 1.6 million individuals identify as transgender and gender diverse (TGD), encompassing a wide range of identities and experiences. Despite progress in visibility and acceptance, TGD people continue to face health care and societal disparities, especially affecting racial minorities. Although legal advancements have been achieved, the key to addressing these persistent health care disparities lies in implementing comprehensive and culturally sensitive health care practices and supportive policies. With a growing number of TGD people seeking gender-affirming care, it is imperative that health care practitioners understand the unique challenges faced by this community and provide tailored services with sensitivity and expertise."
156,"Measurement-based care (MBC), or the regular use of progress measures to inform clinical decision-making, improves quality of care and clinical outcomes. MBC typically focuses on standardized rather than individualized outcome measurement. In this pilot study, we examined the clinical utility of integrating individualized measurement with existing standardized outcome monitoring in a children's partial hospitalization program. Participants were 48 youth (M age 10.13 ± 1.39; 54.2% male, 41.7% female, 4.2% transgender or nonbinary). Comorbidity was common; 83.4% of youth had more than one diagnosis at intake. Using the Youth Top Problems for individualized outcome measurement, we examined Top Problem content and clinical improvement over time. Finally, we examined completion rates and describe implementation issues. Top Problems were heterogeneous and sensitive to change. Of the 144 problems, 107 (74%) had a focus consistent with measures used in program, while 37 (26%) were not captured by standardized measures used in program. Effect sizes from admission to final measurement ranged from Cohen's d = .75 - 1.00. Initial adoption of the MBC was strong, but sustained use of the system over the treatment course was challenging. Individualized outcome measurement in children's partial hospitalization programs is feasible to administer and sensitive to clinical change that is unique from change captured in standardized measures. Parents were able to self-identify clinically meaningful, highly individualized Top Problems. Challenges of implementation and clinical assessment in acute settings and potential strategies for improving implementation are discussed."

158,"Sexual violence (SV) on college campuses disproportionately affects cisgender (nontransgender) women, sexual minorities (e.g., gays/lesbians, bisexuals), and gender minority (e.g., transgender/nonbinary) people. This study investigates gender and sexual behavior differences in common SV intervention targets-SV-related knowledge, prevention behaviors, and care-seeking. We analyzed cross-sectional survey data, collected in 9/2015-3/2017, from 2202 students aged 18-24 years attending college health and counseling centers at 28 Pennsylvania and West Virginia campuses. Multivariable multilevel models tested gender and sexual behavior differences in SV history; recognition of SV; prevention behaviors (self-efficacy to obtain sexual consent, intentions to intervene, positive bystander behaviors); and care-seeking behaviors (knowledge of, self-efficacy to use, and actual use of SV services). Adjusting for lifetime exposure to SV, compared with cisgender men, cisgender women had higher recognition of SV and reproductive coercion, prevention behaviors, and care-seeking self-efficacy (beta range 0.19-1.36) and gender minority people had higher recognition of SV and intentions to intervene (beta range 0.33-0.61). Cisgender men with any same-gender sexual partners had higher SV knowledge (beta = 0.23) and self-efficacy to use SV services (beta = 0.52) than cisgender men with only opposite-gender partners. SV history did not explain these differences. Populations most vulnerable to SV generally have higher SV knowledge, prevention behaviors, and care-seeking behaviors than cisgender men with only opposite-gender sexual partners. Innovative SV intervention approaches are necessary to increase SV-related knowledge among heterosexual cisgender men and may need to target alternative mechanisms to effectively reduce inequities for sexual and gender minority people."
159,"People exposed to more unfavourable social circumstances are more vulnerable to poor mental health over their life course, in ways that are often determined by structural factors which generate and perpetuate intergenerational cycles of disadvantage and poor health. Addressing these challenges is an imperative matter of social justice. In this paper we provide a roadmap to address the social determinants that cause mental ill health. Relying as far as possible on high-quality evidence, we first map out the literature that supports a causal link between social determinants and later mental health outcomes. Given the breadth of this topic, we focus on the most pervasive social determinants across the life course, and those that are common across major mental disorders. We draw primarily on the available evidence from the Global North, acknowledging that other global contexts will face both similar and unique sets of social determinants that will require equitable attention. Much of our evidence focuses on mental health in groups who are marginalized, and thus often exposed to a multitude of intersecting social risk factors. These groups include refugees, asylum seekers and displaced persons, as well as ethnoracial minoritized groups; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) groups; and those living in poverty. We then introduce a preventive framework for conceptualizing the link between social determinants and mental health and disorder, which can guide much needed primary prevention strategies capable of reducing inequalities and improving population mental health. Following this, we provide a review of the evidence concerning candidate preventive strategies to intervene on social determinants of mental health. These interventions fall broadly within the scope of universal, selected and indicated primary prevention strategies, but we also briefly review important secondary and tertiary strategies to promote recovery in those with existing mental disorders. Finally, we provide seven key recommendations, framed around social justice, which constitute a roadmap for action in research, policy and public health. Adoption of these recommendations would provide an opportunity to advance efforts to intervene on modifiable social determinants that affect population mental health."
160,"Gender and sexual minority individuals experience higher rates of mistreatment and discrimination in healthcare compared with their non-lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other nonheterosexual (LGBTQ+) peers. The Healthcare Equality Index (HEI) aims to create more inclusive environments and to provide metrics for quality improvement. Currently, only one adult hospital in the District of Columbia has earned the highest recognition from the HEI. Our institution is part of the same regional health system as this hospital, yet has never been evaluated by the HEI. This study explores the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions surrounding the HEI at our institution to assess the feasibility of its participation. During the study period of July 2021 to June 2022, a total of 12 physicians, administrators, and educators from both hospitals and our affiliated school of medicine were interviewed. All participants expressed support after HEI requirements and improving inclusivity for LGBTQ+ patients. Participants at the other hospital cited unanimous support amongst hospital administrators as key for successful HEI implementation. Participants also mentioned cost, staff shortages, and the school of medicine's religious affiliation as potential barriers to this goal. Ultimately, hospital implementation of HEI guidelines is feasible despite shifting institutional priorities and resource limitations through greater stakeholder buy-in and streamlining a systemwide approach."
161,"This study sought to understand how transgender and gender non-binary (TGNB) individuals skillfully cope with healthcare services and to explore how childhood experiences impact expectations, habits, and meaning-making when utilizing healthcare services. Using an interpretive phenomenological approach, we sampled 17, White TGNB adults in the United States, ages 19 to 57, using semi-structed interviews about childhood experiences with healthcare utilization and adult experiences seeking genderaffirming healthcare. Analysis identified one main theme-Anticipate the worst in healthcare and be pleasantly surprised-and three subthemes: i) contrast between positive childhood and negative adulthood experiences in medical care; ii) coping practices for the worst; and iii) finding your unicorn doctor and medical staff for pleasant experiences. Results indicate participants experienced a disruption and acquisition of new coping practices in healthcare settings and the cultivation of a radical imagination for a more liberated medical world for TGNB people. Implications for providers and medical offices for empowering TGNB adults are described."

163,"Tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and management in special populations remain challenging. Data about TB and transgender individuals is scarce, and strategies aimed at reducing the TB burden in this at-risk group are needed. We conducted an observational monocentric study from a national reference center for TB, including transgender individuals with active TB in a low-TB burden country (Italy), over 34 years (1990-2023). Sixty-six transgender males and two transgender females (median age 30 years, interquartile range 26-38 years, 65 migrants) were included. Most patients (38/66, 57.6%) lived in poor social conditions. 65.2% (43/66) of patients were people living with HIV. Multidrug- and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and isoniazid-resistant TB were diagnosed in five (7.6%) and three (4.5%) patients, respectively. The overall treatment success rate was 72.7% (48/66 patients), with differences observed according to social conditions. Our study highlights the need for a tailored approach to increase treatment success in this at-risk population."

165,"Sexual and gender minority (SGM) people are at greater risk for substance use than heterosexual and cisgender people, but most prior work is limited by cross-sectional analyses or the examination of single substance use. This study examined substance use over time among SGM people to identify patterns of polysubstance use at the intersection of sex and gender.  Data were collected annually over 4 years from SGM respondents  = 11,822) in The Population Research in Identity and Disparities for Equality (PRIDE) Study. Differences in substance use patterns (any prior 30-day use of 15 substances) by gender subgroup were examined with latent class analysis, and multinomial regression models tested relationships between gender subgroup and substance use.  Eight classes of substance use were observed. The three most common patterns were low substance use (49%), heavy episodic alcohol use (≥5 alcoholic drinks on one occasion) with some cannabis and tobacco use (14%), and cannabis use with some tobacco and declining heavy episodic alcohol use (13%). Differences observed included lower odds of patterns defined by heavy episodic alcohol use with some cannabis and tobacco use in all gender subgroups relative to cisgender men and persons with low substance use (odds ratios [ORs] 0.26-0.60). Gender expansive people assigned female at birth, gender expansive people assigned male at birth, and transgender men had greater odds of reporting cannabis use with small percentages of heavy episodic alcohol and tobacco use (ORs: 1.41-1.60).  This study suggests that there are unique patterns of polysubstance use over time among gender subgroups of SGM people."

172,"This article describes the political action repertoire mobilized in the construction of public health policy for trans persons in the Manaus, capital city of the state of Amazonas, in northern Brazil. It is based on ethnographic research combining participant observation in the multiple sites where these policies are constructed and interviews with members of two transgender rights organizations in Manaus, between January 2016 and July 2018. Four modes of political action were reconstructed, as ideal types, named after native categories: those of confrontation, others of ""articulation"", the ones seeking visibility and others collaboration. Each mode has the local society as public and agents of the municipal and state Judiciary, Legislative and Executive bodies sometimes as adversaries, sometimes as allies."
173,"In the past decade, prenatal cell-free DNA screening (cfDNA) has become ubiquitous as a screening tool for fetal aneuploidy and sex chromosomes. Healthcare provider (HCP) discussions and public perceptions of sex and gender uniquely impact transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals, and existing cfDNA guidelines lack recommendations regarding how to discuss sex and gender prenatally. The aim of this exploratory qualitative study was to examine TGD individuals' opinions regarding fetal sex chromosome disclosure sessions. Twelve semi-structured virtual interviews were conducted with TGD individuals regarding their perspectives on the discussion of fetal sex chromosomes by HCPs within the prenatal setting. Interviews were coded and analyzed using a reflexive thematic approach, generating four major themes: (1) Current practices in prenatal care exclude gender diverse people; (2) HCPs' responsibility to de-gender discussions of sex chromosomes in prenatal care; (3) HCPs' responsibility to acknowledge gender diversity; and (4) HCPs' influence on societal perceptions of sex and gender. More guidance is needed from professional societies regarding best practices for HCP discussions of sex chromosomes, sex, and gender. Participants recommended HCPs educate patients about sex chromosomes and their relevance to health while avoiding the conflation of sex and gender terms. Additionally, there is an acute need for trans-inclusive prenatal healthcare. Ultimately, HCPs' and organizations are in a prime position to deconstruct rigid gender binaries and promote societal inclusion of TGD people."

175,"Members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other sexual orientation and gender diverse (SOGD) communities are at disproportionately higher risk for sexual violence compared to cisgender heterosexual people. Despite this elevated risk, relatively few sexual violence prevention efforts effectively reduce these victimization disparities based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This narrative review provides an overview of the prevalence of sexual violence in the SOGD communities, delineates risk factors for sexual victimization among SOGD community members, and reviews and evaluates existing prevention efforts for the SOGD communities. We outline specific recommendations for ensuring that prevention efforts meet the needs of the SOGD communities. Drawing on ecological systems theory and public health approaches to sexual violence prevention, we outline current approaches and opportunities for preventionists and scholars to push the field forward. There have been promising prevention programmes designed to be implemented within SOGD communities specifically; however, it is important that general primary prevention programmes endeavour to specifically address sexual violence perpetrated against SOGD people. While many packaged programmes that endeavour to prevent sexual violence across all gender identities and sexual orientations are inclusive of SOGD participants, more programming is needed that integrates anti-oppression training to target social norms that perpetuate SOGD-specific rape myths and normalize sexual violence against SOGD community members. Ecological prevention strategies in line with a public health approach for primary prevention may be particularly valuable for reducing victimization disparities based on SOGD status and identity. Comprehensive sexual education and anti-discrimination policies should be considered front-line prevention programming. To assess if these strategies are effective, the implementation of large-scale surveillance surveys that use comprehensive assessments of sexual orientation, gender identity, and sexual violence are needed. Using theoretically grounded implementation strategies for prevention programmes can ensure effective programme delivery."
176,"The field of behavioral neuroendocrinology has only begun to explore the lived experiences of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people exposed to stigma. In light of escalating attacks and legislation targeting TGD people in the United States, it is crucial to examine the physiological pathways through which gender minority stressors become embodied, impact health, and contribute to health inequities. The Trans Resilience and Health Study included baseline data collection from fall 2019 to spring 2020 from a sample of 124 TGD people, reflecting a diversity of gender identities (e.g., trans masculine, trans feminine, and nonbinary) and ages (range = 19-70 years old; M = 34.10), living in Michigan, Nebraska, Oregon, and Tennessee. These analyses examine experiences of gender-related enacted stigma in association with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis functioning. Among those experiencing the highest levels of enacted stigma, findings show a blunted cortisol awakening response and sluggish daily decline that resulted in elevated concentrations at bedtime compared to those experiencing less enacted stigma. These results of flattened diurnal activity are consistent with an emergent literature on discrimination as a social determinant of potential stress pathophysiology. In contrast, community connectedness was associated with a larger, more dynamic cortisol awakening response. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating gender-minority stress and resilience measures when studying HPA-axis functioning among TGD people."

191,This study aimed to describe patient experiences and attitudes about the role of the mental health professional as it relates to pursuing gender affirmation surgery.
192,"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other LGBTQ populations (LGBTQ+; e.g., asexual individuals) have higher rates of substance use (SU) and disorders (SUD) compared to heterosexual and cisgender populations. Such disparities can be attributed to minority stress, including stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings. LGBTQ+-affirming SU treatment and related services remain limited. The purpose of this exploratory qualitative descriptive study was to characterize LGBTQ+ people's experiences in SU services and recommendations for LGBTQ+- affirming care."

194,"Sexual and gender minority stress is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes, such as hypertension and depression. Expanding on previous reviews of the literature on cross-sectional and long-term prospective associations between sexual and gender minority stress and health outcomes, the current systematic review synthesizes the evidence on how everyday sexual and gender minority stress relates to momentary changes in health. The findings of 53 experience sampling studies published between 2007 and 2022 suggest that daily and momentary within-persons fluctuations in minority stressors are associated with cognitive-emotional (e.g., affect, suicidality), behavioral (e.g., substance use), social (e.g., relationship satisfaction), and physical health outcomes (e.g., somatic symptoms). These findings suggest that sexual and gender minority stress is a dynamic process that can vary within individuals over time and significantly impact everyday mental and physical health. We discuss the implications of these findings for minority stress theory, LGBTQ+ health research, LGBTQ+ affirming therapy, and prevention initiatives. The current experience sampling literature is limited by a lack of attention to gender minority stress and a focus on a limited range of health outcomes. Methodological and theoretical considerations for future experience sampling research are discussed in light of these limitations."
195,"While recent research has begun to address the effects of family support on transgender and/or nonbinary youth (TNY), almost no studies have directly examined how cisgender siblings in families with TNY navigate their sibling's gender disclosure and affirmation within both their families and their larger communities. We conducted an exploratory secondary analysis of in-person, semi-structured interviews with 15 adolescent and young adult siblings (age 13-24 years) of TNY from the northeastern United States from the baseline wave of the community-based, longitudinal, mixed methods Trans Teen and Family Narratives Project. Interview transcripts were analyzed using immersion/crystallization and template organizing approaches. Analyses yielded three main themes: gender-related beliefs and knowledge, peri- and post-disclosure family dynamics, and assessing responses to their sibling. Subthemes included anticipation of their sibling's TN identity, expectations post-disclosure, participants' level of involvement in gender-related family processes, perceptions of changes in family relationships, concern for their sibling (including a high degree of attunement to gender-affirming name and pronoun usage), and concern for themselves. Findings from this study suggest the need to engage directly with siblings of TNY to further elucidate their intrapersonal, intra-familial, and extra-familial experiences related to having a TN sibling and determine their unique support needs. Implications for families, clinicians, and communities are discussed."
196,"While acne is common in transgender and gender-diverse people and is associated with gender-affirming hormone therapy, little research has examined these factors and their impact in gender minority groups."
197,This narrative review of research conducted during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic examines whether alcohol use among cisgender women and transgender and nonbinary people increased during the pandemic. The overarching goal of the review is to inform intervention and prevention efforts to halt the narrowing of gender-related differences in alcohol use.
198,"Emerging research has demonstrated that transgender and non-binary (TNB) individuals face an elevated risk of experiencing family rejection and violence. However, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding how TNB individuals manage stressors and their gender identity within the family context, particularly in regions where TNB individuals are highly stigmatized and where legal protections against family violence are lacking. The present study represents one of the first pioneering efforts to provide large-scale quantitative data examining the experiences of family stressors, the management of gender identity and expression, and family violence among TNB individuals in China. A national sample of 1063 TNB individuals in China was involved in the study. They completed questionnaires about their experiences of family stressors and violence. The results indicated that 76.0% of TNB individuals reported having encountered at least one form of violence perpetrated by their family members. Transfeminine individuals were more likely to report experiencing emotional and physical abuse, whereas transmasculine individuals were more likely to be subjected to gender identity and/or expression change efforts. Family stressors, including family non-acceptance and the pressure to marry and reproduce, were positively associated with non-disclosure of gender identity, the suppression of gender expression, and family violence. The findings underscore the substantial burden of family violence borne by TNB individuals in China, which warrants immediate legal, institutional, and social responses. Trans-inclusive family violence prevention and intervention are urgently needed, with a focus on Chinese cultural factors and gender identity differences in violence screening and risk assessment."
